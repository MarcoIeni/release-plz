Release-plz helps you release your Rust packages by automating:

- CHANGELOG generation (with [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org)).
- Creation of GitHub/Gitea releases.
- Publishing to a cargo registry (`crates.io` by default).
- Version bumps in `Cargo.toml`.

Release-plz updates your packages with a release Pull Request based on:

- Your git history, following [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- API breaking changes (detected by [cargo-semver-checks](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks)).

## 🤔 What's a Release PR?

Release-plz maintains Release PRs, keeping them up-to-date as you merge additional commits. When you're
ready to create a release, simply merge the release PR.

When you merge the Release PR (or when you edit the `Cargo.toml` versions by yourself),
release-plz:

- Creates a git tag named `<package_name>-v<version>` (e.g. `tokio-v1.8.1`).
- Publishes the package to the cargo registry by running `cargo publish`.
- Publishes a GitHub/Gitea release based on the git tag.

## 📽️ RustLab 23 talk

In RustLab 23, I showed how release-plz simplifies releasing Rust packages, why I created it, and what lessons I learned:

- [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please): release-plz is inspired by release-please,
  but instead of determining the next versions based on git tags, release-plz compares local packages with
  the ones published in the cargo registry.
  Plus, release-plz doesn't need any configuration and is optimized for Rust projects.

  Fearlessly release workspace crates and with beautiful semi-handcrafted changelogs.
