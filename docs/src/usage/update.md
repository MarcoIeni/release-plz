# Update

The `release-plz update` command updates the version and the changelog of the
packages of a local workspace.

The command:

- Downloads the packages of the project from the cargo registry.
- Compares the local packages with the downloaded ones to determine the new commits.
- Updates the packages versions based on the messages of the new commits (based
  on [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and
  [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)).
- Updates the packages changelogs with the messages of the new commits.
- Updates all dependencies by running `cargo update` (disabled by default).

In the following example, I run `release-plz` on the `release-plz` project itself.
`Release-plz` increases the version and the changelog of the packages with
unpublished changes.

## FAQ

### Does the changelog include the commits from the whole repo?

The changelog of each crate includes the commit that changed one of the
files of the crate or one of its dependencies.

### What if a commit doesn't follow the conventional-commits format?

By default, it will be listed under the section `### Other`.
Remember you can customize the changelog format by providing a
[git-cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff) config file.
