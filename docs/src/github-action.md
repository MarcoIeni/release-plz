# GitHub action

The simplest way to run release-plz is via the [GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-plz).

By default, every time you merge a commit to the main branch, the GitHub action
runs two commands: [`release-plz release-pr`](usage/release-pr.md) and
[`release-plz release`](usage/release.md).
