# Configuration

This section describes how you can customize the behavior of release-plz
with the `release-plz.toml` file.

This configuration file is optional — release-plz is designed to work out of the box,
with decent defaults.

:::tip
If you are just trying out release-plz, you can skip this section and come back to it later.
If you are using release-plz to release important projects, make sure to check the
[`release_always`](#the-release_always-field) field.
:::

Put your `release-plz.toml` (or `.release-plz.toml`) file in the same directory of your root `Cargo.toml`.

## Example

Here's an example configuration file for a cargo workspace.
`package_a`, `package_b` and `package_c` override some fields from the default configuration `[workspace]`,
while the other packages inherit the default configuration.

```toml
[workspace]
allow_dirty = true # allow updating repositories with uncommitted changes
changelog_config = "config/git-cliff.toml" # use a custom git-cliff configuration
changelog_update = false # disable changelog updates
dependencies_update = true # update dependencies with `cargo update`
git_release_enable = false # disable GitHub/Gitea releases
pr_branch_prefix = "release-plz-" # PR branch prefix
pr_name = "Release {{ package }} v{{ version }}" # template for the PR name
pr_labels = ["release"] # add the `release` label to the release Pull Request
publish_allow_dirty = true # add `--allow-dirty` to `cargo publish`
semver_check = false # disable API breaking changes checks
publish_timeout = "10m" # set a timeout for `cargo publish`
release_commits = "^feat:" # prepare release only if at least one commit matches a regex

[[package]] # the double square brackets define a TOML table array
name = "package_a"
changelog_include = ["package_b"] # include commits from `package_b` in the changelog
changelog_path = "docs/CHANGELOG.md" # use a custom changelog path for `package_a`
changelog_update = true # enable changelog update for `package_a`
git_release_enable = true # enable GitHub/Gitea releases for `package_a`
publish = false # disable `cargo publish` for `package_a`

[[package]]
name = "package_b"
semver_check = true # enable semver_check for `package_b`
publish_no_verify = true # add `--no-verify` to `cargo publish` for `package_b`
publish_features = ["a", "b"] # add `--features=a,b` to `cargo publish` for `package_b`
publish_all_features = true # add `--all-features` to `cargo publish` for `package_b`

[[package]]
name = "package_c"
release = false # don't process this package

[changelog]
protect_breaking_commits = true # always include commits with breaking changes in the changelog
```

### The `[workspace]` section

Defines the global configuration, applied to all packages by default.
This section is optional, as well as all its fields.

Here's an example configuration:

```toml
[workspace]
allow_dirty = true # allow updating repositories with uncommitted changes
changelog_config = "config/git-cliff.toml"
changelog_update = false
dependencies_update = true # update dependencies with `cargo update`
git_release_enable = true
pr_branch_prefix = "feat-pr-" # Release PR branch prefix
publish_allow_dirty = true
publish_no_verify = false
repo_url = "https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>"
semver_check = false
```

#### The `allow_dirty` field

- If `true`, allow release-plz to update dirty working directories.
  A directory is considered dirty if it contains uncommitted changes.
  The uncommitted changes will be part of the update.
- If `false`, release-plz returns an error if the repository contains uncommitted changes. *(Default)*.

:::caution
This field is different from the `allow-dirty` flag of the `release-plz release` command.
This field only affects the `release-plz update` and `release-plz release-pr` command.
:::

#### The `changelog_config` field

Path to the [git-cliff] configuration file.
If unspecified, release-plz uses the [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format.

:::warning
This field is deprecated.
Instead of specifying a `git-cliff` configuration file,
use the [changelog](#the-changelog-section) section instead.

> Why do you prefer having a `changelog` section in the `release-plz.toml` file,
> instead of having the changelog configuration in the `git-cliff.toml` file?

The `git-cliff.toml` contains many options that release-plz doesn't use.
To avoid confusion, release-plz has a `[changelog]` section,
containing only the options it uses.

Ideally, release-plz users shouldn't need to read the `git-cliff` documentation
to customize their changelog.
:::

#### The `changelog_update` field

- If `true`, update the changelog of the crates. *(Default)*.
- If `false`, don't update changelogs.

This field can be overridden in the [`[package]`](#the-package-section) section.

#### The `dependencies_update` field

- If `true`, update all the dependencies in the `Cargo.lock` file by running `cargo update`.
- If `false`, only update the workspace packages by running `cargo update --workspace`. *(Default)*.

#### The `features_always_increment_minor` field

- If `true`, feature commits will always bump the minor version, even in 0.x releases.
- If `false` (default), feature commits will only bump the minor version starting with 1.x releases.

:::warning
This option violates the Cargo SemVer
[rules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/semver.html) because the transition from
`0.x` to `0.(x+1)` is used for breaking changes.
Instead, new features for `0.x` should bump the version from `0.x.y` to `0.x.(y+1)`.
:::

#### The `git_release_enable` field

- If `true`, release-plz creates a git release for the created tag. *(Default)*.
- If `false`, release-plz doesn't create a git release.

The supported git releases are:

- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)
- [Gitea](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/)
- [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#releases)

#### The `git_release_name` field

[Tera template](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#templates) of the git release name that
release-plz creates.
Use this to customize the git release name pattern.

By default, it's:

- `"{{ package }}-v{{ version }}"` for workspaces containing more than one public package.
- `"v{{ version }}"` for projects containing a single crate or
  workspaces containing just one public package.

Where:

- `{{ package }}` is the name of the package.
- `{{ version }}` is the new version of the package.

#### The `git_release_body` field

[Tera template](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#templates) of the git release body that
release-plz creates.
Use this to customize the git release body pattern.

By default, it's `"{{ changelog }}"`.

In `git_release_body`, you can use the following variables:

- `{{ changelog }}`: the changelog body of the new release.
- `{{ package }}`: the name of the package.
- `{{ version }}`: the new version of the package.
- `{{ remote.contributors }}`: array of contributors.
  I.e. the username of the authors of the PRs present in the changelog.
  This means that your commit messages should contain the PR number, e.g. `(#123)`
  or `([#1421](https://github.com/me/proj/pull/1421))`.

:::tip
To list the contributors at the end of the release you can do the following:

```toml
git_release_body = """
{{ changelog }}
{% if remote.contributors %}
### Contributors
{% for contributor in remote.contributors %}
* @{{ contributor.username }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
"""
```

:::

#### The `git_release_type` field

Define whether to label the release as production or non-production ready.
Supported values are:

- `"prod"`: will mark the release as ready for production. *(Default)*.
- `"pre"`: will mark the release as not ready for production (pre-release).
- `"auto"`:
  - if there's a SemVer pre-release in the version (e.g. `v1.0.0-rc1`), will mark the release as
    not ready for production (pre-release).
  - if there isn't a semver pre-release in the version (e.g. `v1.0.0`), will mark the release as
    ready for production.

*(GitHub, Gitea only)*.

#### The `git_release_draft` field

- If `true`, release-plz creates the git release as draft (unpublished).
- If `false`, release-plz publishes the created git release. *(Default)*.

*(GitHub, Gitea only)*.

#### The `git_release_latest` field

- If `true`, release-plz creates the git release as latest. *(Default)*.
- If `false`, release-plz doesn't set the git release it creates as latest.

*(GitHub only)*. Gitea doesn't support this feature.

:::warning
Drafts and prereleases cannot be set as latest.
:::

#### The `git_tag_enable` field

- If `true`, release-plz creates a git tag for the new package version. *(Default)*.
- If `false`, release-plz doesn't create a git tag.
  Note: you can't create a git release without a git tag.

#### The `git_tag_name` field

[Tera template](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#templates) of the git tags that release-plz creates.
Use this to customize the git tags name pattern.

By default, it's:

- `"{{ package }}-v{{ version }}"` for workspaces containing more than one public package.
- `"v{{ version }}"` for projects containing a single crate or
  workspaces containing just one public package.

Where:

- `{{ package }}` is the name of the package.
- `{{ version }}` is the new version of the package.

#### The `pr_name` field

[Tera template](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#templates) of pull request's name that
release-plz creates.

By default, it's:

- `chore({{ package }}): release v{{ version }}` for releasing only one package from a workspace with
multiple publishable packages.
  This happens when only one package changed.
- `chore: release v{{ version }}` for releasing either:
  - the only package of the project
  - multiple packages with the same version
- `chore: release` for releasing multiple packages with different versions.

Where:

- `{{ package }}` is the name of the package.
- `{{ version }}` is the new version of the package(s).

When using a custom template:

- `{{ package }}` is populated only when releasing a single package.
- `{{ version }}` is populated only when releasing a single package or multiple packages with the
  same version.

Here's an example of how you can customize the PR name template:

```toml
[workspace]
pr_name = "release: {{ package }} {{ version }}"
```

#### The `pr_body` field

[Tera template](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#templates) of pull request's body that
release-plz creates.

By default it contains the summary of package updates, the changelog for each package, a section
for breaking changes, and a footer with credits for release-plz. The text is trimmed to a length
of 65536, because that's the limit imposed by Github.

Here is an example of how you can customize the PR body template:

```toml
[workspace]
pr_body = """
{% for release in releases %}
{% if release.title %}
### {{release.title}}
{% endif %}
Package: {{release.package}} {{release.previous_version}} -> {{release.next_version}}
{% if release.changelog %}
Changes:
{{release.changelog}}
{% endif %}
{% endfor -%}
"""
```

Where:

:::warning
`{{ release.title }}` and `{{ release.changelog }}` may be unset if the changelog could
not be parsed or it's not available. Please use `{% if <variable> %}` structures
to check for their existence.
:::

- `{{ releases }}` - an array with the update information of each package.
- `{{ release.title }}` - the changelog title containing a link to the release tag diff.
  *(Optional)*.
- `{{ release.package }}` - the name of the package being updated.
- `{{ release.changelog }}` - the generated changelog. *(Optional)*.
- `{{ release.previous_version }}` - the previous version of the package.
- `{{ release.next_version }}` - the version of the package being released.
- `{{ release.breaking_changes }}` - the summary of the breaking changes of the package being
  released. *(Optional)*.

#### The `pr_branch_prefix` field

Prefix for the release PR branch. By default, it's set to: `release-plz-`

:::warning
Before changing the release-plz branch you should close the old release PR.
:::

#### The `pr_draft` field

- If `true`, release-plz creates the release PR as a draft.
- If `false`, release-plz creates the release PR as ready for review. *(Default)*.

#### The `pr_labels` field

Add labels to the Pull Request opened by release-plz.
*(GitHub and GitLab only)*.

Example:

```toml
[workspace]
pr_labels = ["release"] # add the `release` label to the release Pull Request
```

By default, release-plz doesn't add any label.
I.e. the `pr_labels` array is empty.

#### The `publish` field

Publish to cargo registry.

- If `true`, `release-plz` runs `cargo publish`. *(Default)*.
- If `false`, `release-plz` doesn't run `cargo publish`.

With this option disabled, release-plz will continue creating git tags.
However, note that release-plz will still use the cargo registry to check what's the latest
release, so you still need to run `cargo publish` by yourself.

#### The `publish_allow_dirty` field

Allow dirty working directories to be packaged.

- If `true`, `release-plz` adds the `--allow-dirty` flag to `cargo publish`.
- If `false`, `cargo publish` fails if your repository contains uncommitted changes. *(Default)*.

#### The `publish_no_verify` field

Don't verify the contents by building them.

- If `true`, `release-plz` adds the `--no-verify` flag to `cargo publish`.
- If `false`, `cargo publish` fails if your repository doesn't build. *(Default)*.

#### The `publish_features` field

Pass a list of features to use for verification by `cargo publish`.

- If set to a list of features (e.g. `["a", "b"]`), `release-plz` adds `--features=a,b` flag to
  `cargo publish`.
- If not set or if it is empty, no list of features will be passed to `cargo publish`.

#### The `publish_all_features` field

Whether to pass the `--all-features` to `cargo publish` when verifying.

- If `true`, `release-plz` adds the `--all-features` flag to `cargo publish`.
- If `false`, `release-plz` doesn't add the `--all-features` flag to `cargo publish`.

#### The `publish_timeout` field

The timeout used when:

- publishing a crate, i.e. `cargo publish`.
- checking if a crate is published.

It's a string in the format `<duration><unit>`. E.g.:

- `30s` — 30 seconds
- `10m` — 10 minutes
- `1h` — 1 hour

Example:

```toml
[workspace]
publish_timeout = "10m"
```

By default, this timeout is set to `30m`.

This timeout is useful when there are some problems regarding the cargo
registry or local configuration, allowing to:

- avoid CI job to run forever.
- have a more precise error message.

#### The `release` field

Process the packages for the `update`, `release-pr`, and `release` commands.

- If `true`, all packages will be processed. *(Default)*.
- If `false`, no packages will be processed.
  Release-plz doesn't update the package, and doesn't release it (i.e. cargo publish, git tag
  and github/gitea/gitlab release).
  Release-plz ignores all packages.

Setting `release` as `false` at the workspace level,
is useful in big workspaces, where you don't want release-plz to manage all crates.
You can set `release` as `true` only in the packages you want release-plz to handle, by overriding
this configuration at the [`[[package]]`](#the-package-section) level.

Example:

```toml
[workspace]
release = false
```

#### The `release_always` field

- If true, `release-plz release` will try to release your packages every time you run it
  (e.g. on every commit in the main branch). *(Default)*.

  :::warning
  In this case, every package is published as soon as you commit it.
  Also, if you merge your PRs with the
  [squash](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits)
  strategy, there could be a race condition if you merge a PR before `release-plz release`
  finished on the main branch. For more info about this issue, see
  [what commit is released](./usage/release.md#what-commit-is-released).
  :::

- If false, `release-plz release` will try to release your packages only when you merge the
  release PR.
  Use `release_always = false` if you want to commit your packages and publish them later,
  instead of publishing them as soon as you commit them.
  :::info
  To do this, release-plz checks if the latest commit is
  [associated](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/commits?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-pull-requests-associated-with-a-commit)
  to a release PR.
  To determine if a PR is a release-pr, release-plz will check if the branch of the PR starts with
  `release-plz-`. So if you want to create a PR that should trigger a release
  (e.g. when you fix the CI), use this branch name format (e.g. `release-plz-fix-ci`).
  :::
  :::info
  The release pr is opened only when a file of the package is updated.
  To verify your packaged files, run `cargo package --list`.
  :::

Example:

```toml
[workspace]
release_always = false
```

:::info
Supported on GitHub only.
Gitea should work when they implement the
`/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/pull`
API (maybe in Gitea 1.22?).
:::

#### The `release_commits` field

In `release-plz update` and `release-plz release-pr`, `release-plz` bumps the version and updates
the changelog of the package only if at least one of the commits matches the `release_commits`
regex.

You can use this if you think it is too noisy to raise PRs on every commit.

Examples:

- With `release_commits = "^feat:"`, release-plz will update the package only if there's a new feature.
- With `release_commits = "^(feat:|docs:)"`, release-plz will update the package only if there's a
  new feature or a documentation change.

By default, release-plz updates the package on every commit.

:::warning
The filtered commits are still included in the changelog.
To exclude certain commits from the changelog, use the [commit_parsers](#the-commit_parsers-field) field.
:::

#### The `repo_url` field

GitHub/Gitea repository URL where your project is hosted.
It is used to generate the changelog release link and open the PR.
Normally, you don't need to set this field,
because release-plz defaults to the URL of the default git remote.

#### The `semver_check` field

With this field, you can tell release-plz to run [cargo-semver-checks] to check
API breaking changes of your package:

- If `true`, run it. *(Default)*.
- If `false`, don't run it.

:::info
[cargo-semver-checks] only works with packages containing a library.
:::

This field can be overridden in the [`[package]`](#the-package-section) section.

### The `[[package]]` section

In this section, you can override some of the `workspace` fields for specific packages.

Here's an example configuration where we override the configuration of the `my_package` package:

```toml
[[package]]
name = "my_package"
changelog_path = "docs/CHANGELOG.md"
semver_check = false
changelog_update = false
git_release_enable = true
publish = true
publish_allow_dirty = true
publish_no_verify = true
```

#### The `name` field

Name of the package to which the configuration applies.
*(Required field)*.

#### The `changelog_include` field

By default, release-plz populates the changelog of a package with commits
containing changes in files of the package directory.
You can use the `changelog_include` field to include commits that belong to other packages.
For example, the changelog of the `release-plz` package of this repository
includes commits of the `release_plz_core` package, because they affect the
`release-plz` package, too.

Example:

```toml
changelog_include = ["release_plz_core"]
```

#### The `changelog_path` field (`package` section)

By default, release-plz looks for the changelog in the `CHANGELOG.md` file
of the same directory of the `Cargo.toml` of the package:

```txt
.
├── src/
├── CHANGELOG.md
└── Cargo.toml
```

If the changelog of a package is in a different location, you can specify it with this field.

This field is relative to the root `Cargo.toml` file.
In GitHub Actions, this is the root of the repository.

This field cannot be set in the `[workspace]` section.

#### The `changelog_update` field (`package` section)

- If `true`, update the changelog of this package. *(Default)*.
- If `false`, don't.

#### The `features_always_increment_minor` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.features_always_increment_minor`](#the-features_always_increment_minor-field)
field.

#### The `git_release_enable` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.git_release_enable`](#the-git_release_enable-field) field.

#### The `git_release_name` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.git_release_name`](#the-git_release_name-field) field.

#### The `git_release_body` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.git_release_body`](#the-git_release_body-field) field.

#### The `git_release_type` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.git_release_type`](#the-git_release_type-field) field.

#### The `git_release_draft` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.git_release_draft`](#the-git_release_draft-field) field.

#### The `git_release_latest` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.git_release_latest`](#the-git_release_latest-field) field.

#### The `git_tag_enable` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.git_tag_enable`](#the-git_tag_enable-field) field.

#### The `git_tag_name` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.git_tag_name`](#the-git_tag_name-field) field.

#### The `publish` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.publish`](#the-publish-field) field.

#### The `publish_allow_dirty` field (`package` section)

Overrides the
[`workspace.publish_allow_dirty`](#the-publish_allow_dirty-field) field.

#### The `publish_no_verify` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.publish_no_verify`](#the-publish_no_verify-field) field.

#### The `publish_features` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.publish_features`](#the-publish_features-field) field.

#### The `publish_all_features` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.publish_all_features`](#the-publish_all_features-field) field.

#### The `release` field (`package` section)

Overrides the [`workspace.release`](#the-release-field) field.

#### The `semver_check` field (`package` section)

- If `true`, run [cargo-semver-checks] for this package.
- If `false`, don't.

By default, release-plz runs [cargo-semver-checks] if the package is a library.

[cargo-semver-checks]: https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks
[git-cliff]: https://git-cliff.org

#### The `version_group` field

The name of a group of packages that needs to have the same version.
If two or more packages share the same `version_group` then release-plz will
assign the same version to them (the highest among the next versions of the packages).

:::tip
Think of this as having a `Cargo.toml` workspace version shared among subgroups of packages
instead of the entire workspace.
:::

With the following configuration example, `release-plz update` and `release-plz release-pr`
will set `aaa` and `bbb` to the same version
(the highest of the next version of the `aaa` and `bbb` packages), while the other packages
of the workspace are updated independently.

```toml
[[package]]
name = "aaa"
version_group = "group1"

[[package]]
name = "bbb"
version_group = "group1"
```

:::note
The version group is considered only when packages contain changes.

**Example**

Package `aaa` (version `0.1.0`) adds a non breaking change while `bbb` (version `0.2.0`)
wasn't updated since last release.
In this case release-plz will only update `aaa` to `0.1.1` and `bbb` will remain `0.2.0`.
However, if `bbb` depends on `aaa`, then `bbb` is updated too and the version is set to `0.2.1`
for both packages.

### The `[changelog]` section

Here's an example configuration, more customization examples available in the
[Examples](./changelog/examples.md) section.

```toml
[changelog]
header = "# Changelog"
body = "Body"
trim = true
protect_breaking_commits = true
sort_commits = "newest"

commit_preprocessors = [
  # remove issue numbers from commits
  { pattern = '\((\w+\s)?#([0-9]+)\)', replace = "" },
]

commit_parsers = [
    { message = "^.*: add", group = "Added" },
    { message = "^.*: support", group = "Added" },
    { message = "^.*: remove", group = "Removed" },
    { message = "^.*: delete", group = "Removed" },
    { message = "^test", group = "Fixed" },
    { message = "^fix", group = "Fixed" },
    { message = "^.*: fix", group = "Fixed" },
    { message = "^.*", group = "Changed" },
]

link_parsers = [
    { pattern = "RFC(\\d+)", text = "ietf-rfc$1", href = "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc$1"}
]
```

#### The `header` field

Text at the beginning of the changelog.

Default:

```toml
[changelog]
header = """# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

"""
```

#### The `body` field

Template that represents a single release in the changelog.
It contains the commit messages.
Learn more about the template syntax in the changelog format [docs](./changelog/format.md).

Default:

```toml
[changelog]
body = """
## [{{ version | trim_start_matches(pat="v") }}]{%- if release_link -%}({{ release_link }}){% endif %} - {{ timestamp | date(format="%Y-%m-%d") }}
{% for group, commits in commits | group_by(attribute="group") %}
### {{ group | upper_first }}
{% for commit in commits %}
{%- if commit.scope -%}
- *({{commit.scope}})* {% if commit.breaking %}[**breaking**] {% endif %}{{ commit.message }}{%- if commit.links %} ({% for link in commit.links %}[{{link.text}}]({{link.href}}) {% endfor -%}){% endif %}
{% else -%}
- {% if commit.breaking %}[**breaking**] {% endif %}{{ commit.message }}
{% endif -%}
{% endfor -%}
{% endfor %}
"""
```

#### The `trim` field

If set to `true`, leading and trailing whitespace are removed from the [body](#the-body-field).

It is useful for adding indentation to the template for readability.

Default: `true`.

#### The `protect_breaking_commits` field

If `true`, [commit_parsers](#the-commit_parsers-field) won't skip any commits with breaking
changes, regardless of the filter.

Default: `false`.

#### The `tag_pattern` field

A regular expression for matching the git tags that release-plz should add to the changelog.
If a tag doesn't match the pattern, it won't be added to the changelog.

By default, all tags are included.

#### The `sort_commits` field

Sort the commits inside sections by specified order.

Possible values:

- `oldest`
- `newest`

#### The `commit_preprocessors` field

You can use commit preprocessors to manipulate the commit messages before parsing/grouping them.
Specify a regex `pattern` to `replace` parts of the commit message/body.

Here are some examples:

```toml
commit_preprocessors = [
  # Replace `foo` with `bar`
  { pattern = "foo", replace = "bar" },

  # Replace `<REPO>` in the template body with the repository URL
  { pattern = '<REPO>', replace = "https://github.com/me/my-proj" },

  # Replace multiple spaces with a single space.
  { pattern = "  +", replace = " "}

  # Replace the issue number with the link.
  { pattern = "\\(#([0-9]+)\\)", replace = "([#${1}](https://github.com/me/my-proj/issues/${1}))"}

  # Replace the issue link with the number.
  { pattern = "https://github.com/[^ ]/issues/([0-9]+)", replace = "[Issue #${1}]"}

  # Remove prefix
  { pattern = 'Merged PR #[0-9]: (.*)', replace = "$1"}

  # Remove gitmoji from commit messages, both actual UTF emoji and :emoji:
  { pattern = ' *(:\w+:|[\p{Emoji_Presentation}\p{Extended_Pictographic}\u{200D}]) *', replace = "" },

  # Hyperlink PR references from merge commits.
  { pattern = "Merge pull request #([0-9]+) from [^ ]+", replace = "PR # [${1}](https://github.com/me/my-proj/pull/${1}):"}

  # Hyperlink commit links, with short commit hash as description.
  { pattern = "https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/commit/([a-f0-9]{7})[a-f0-9]*", replace = "commit # [${1}](${0})"}

  # Hyperlink bare commit hashes like "abcd1234" in commit logs, with short commit hash as description.
  { pattern = "([ \\n])(([a-f0-9]{7})[a-f0-9]*)", replace = "${1}commit # [${3}](https://github.com/me/my-proj/commit/${2})"}
]
```

##### Using external commands

Custom OS commands can also be used to edit the commit messages.

For example, here's how you can use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert all commit messages
to the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) format:

- `{ pattern = ".*", replace_command = "pandoc -t commonmark"}`

The `$COMMIT_SHA` environment variable is set when executing the command.
For example, you can read the commit itself:

- `{ pattern = '.*', replace_command = 'git show -s --format=%B $COMMIT_SHA' }`

#### The `commit_parsers` field

An array of parsers allowing to group and skip commits.

Default:

```toml
commit_parsers = [
    { message = "^feat", group = "added" },
    { message = "^changed", group = "changed" },
    { message = "^deprecated", group = "deprecated" },
    { message = "^fix", group = "fixed" },
    { message = "^security", group = "security" },
    { message = "^.*", group = "other" },
]
```

With the default configuration, a commit starting with `feat` will be grouped under
"Added" section in the changelog (e.g. `### Added`).

By default, groups are showed in alphabetical order in the changelog.
To customize the order, see
[changing the group order](./changelog/tips-and-tricks.md#changing-the-group-order).

Here are some examples of parsers:

- `{ body = ".*security", group = "Security" }`
  - Group the commit as "Security" if the commit body contains `security`.
- `{ footer = "^changelog: ?ignore", skip = true }`
  - Skip processing the commit if the commit footer contains `changelog: ignore`.
- `{ message = '^fix\((.*)\)', group = 'Fix (${1})' }`
  - Use the matched scope value from the commit message in the group name.
- `{ message = "^refactor\\(clippy\\)", skip = true }`
  - Skip commits starting with the message `refactor(clippy)`.
- `{ body = "$^", skip = true }`
  - Skip commits with an empty body.
- `{ message = "^doc", group = "Documentation", default_scope = "other" }`
  - If the commit starts with "doc", group the commit as "Documentation" and set the
    default scope to "other".
    E.g. `docs: xyz` will be processed as `docs(other): xyz`.
- `{ sha = "f6f2472bdf0bbb5f9fcaf2d72c1fa9f98f772bb2", skip = true }`
  - Skip a specific commit by using its SHA1.

#### The `link_parsers` field

An array of link parsers for extracting external references, and turning them into URLs, using regex.

Examples:

```toml
link_parsers = [
    # Extract all GitLab issues and PRs and generate URLs linking to them.
    # The link text will be the matching pattern.
    { pattern = "#(\\d+)", href = "https://github.com/me/my-proj/issues/$1"}
    # Extract mentions of IETF RFCs and generate URLs linking to them.
    # It also rewrites the text as "ietf-rfc...".
    { pattern = "RFC(\\d+)", text = "ietf-rfc$1", href = "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc$1"}
]
```

The extracted links can be used in the [body](#the-body-field) with the `commits.links` variable.
