# Security

In the following, we'll discuss some security considerations when using the release-plz GitHub
action and how to mitigate them.

## Using latest version

The examples provided in the documentation use the latest version of the release-plz GitHub action.

For example, the following snippet uses the `v0.5` version of the release-plz GitHub action:

```yaml
jobs:
  release-plz:
    name: Release-plz
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - ...
      - name: Run release-plz
        uses: MarcoIeni/release-plz-action@v0.5
```

[This](https://github.com/MarcoIeni/release-plz-action/blob/main/.github/workflows/update_main_version.yml)
script updates this tag to whatever the latest `0.5.x` version is.
This means that if the latest version of release-plz is 0.5.34, with `v0.5` you will use that version.
If tomorrow, release-plz 0.5.35 is released, you will use that version without the need to update your workflow file.

While this is great for new features and bug fixes, it can also be a security risk.

### ⚠️ Risk: malicious code published on your crates.io crate

An attacker who manages to push and tag malicious code to the GitHub action
[repository](https://github.com/MarcoIeni/release-plz-action)
could use your cargo registry token to push malicious code to
your crate on crates.io.
This means you or your users could download and run the malicious code.

### ✅ Solution: pin the action version

To mitigate this risk, you can use a specific version of the release-plz GitHub action.
By specifying a commit hash, the action won't be updated automatically.

For example:

```yaml
jobs:
  release-plz:
    name: Release-plz
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - ...
      - name: Run release-plz
        uses: MarcoIeni/release-plz-action@63ab0c2746bedc448370bad4b0b3d536458398b0 # v0.5.50

```

This is the same approach used in the crates.io
[repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/blob/7e52e11c5ddeb33db70f0000bbcdfb01e9b43b0d/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L30C32-L31C1).
