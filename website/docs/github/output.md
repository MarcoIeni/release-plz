# Output

After the action runs, it outputs the following properties:

- `prs`: The release PRs opened by release-plz.
  It's an array of objects with the properties of `pr`.
  *(Not useful for now. Use `pr` instead)*.
- `pr`: The release PR opened by release-plz.
  It's a JSON object with the following properties:
  - `head_branch`: The name of the branch where the changes are implemented.
  - `base_branch`: The name of the branch the changes are pulled into.
    It is the default branch of the repository. E.g. `main`.
  - `html_url`: The URL of the PR.
  - `number`: The number of the PR.
- `releases`: The JSON output of the `release` command.
  It's an array of JSON objects with the following properties:
  - `package_name`: The name of the package that was released.
  - `prs`: Array of PRs present in the changelog body of the release.
    Usually, they are the PRs containing the changes that were released.
    Each entry is an object containing:
    - `html_url`: The URL of the PR.
    - `number`: The number of the PR.
  - `tag`: git tag name of the package that was released. It's returned even if you have
    [git_tag_enable](../config.md#the-git_tag_enable-field) set to `false`, so that
    you can use this to create the git tag yourself.
  - `version`: The version of the package that was released.
- `prs_created`: Whether release-plz created any release PR. *Boolean.*
- `releases_created`: Whether release-plz released any package. *Boolean.*

## Example: add labels to released PRs

It often happens, when looking for a feature or a bug fix, to land on a merged PR.
The next question: was this released? In what version?

With release-plz you can add a label to the PRs with the version they were released in:

:::info
In this example, we are talking about the PRs containing code changes.
We aren't talking about the release PRs created by release-plz.
You can label release PRs with the [pr_labels](../config.md#the-pr_labels-field)
configuration field.

You can also add a milestone with `gh pr edit $pr_number --milestone <MILESTONE_NUMBER>`.
