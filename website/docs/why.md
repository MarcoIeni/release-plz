# Why yet another release tool

New Rust apps and rewrites are mushrooming every day.
Choosing which tools to add to your developer toolbox is becoming harder and harder.

I feel obliged to explain why I created this project and how it compares with
similar tools.

## API breaking change detection

Release-plz is the only release tool that integrates
[cargo-semver-checks](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks)
to detect API breaking changes and avoid breaking users builds:

- if the change was not intentional, maintainers can revert the breaking change
  before releasing the new version.
- if the change was intentional, maintainers can safely merge the release PR
  because it bumps the major version.

## Differences with release-please

Like release-plz, [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
is an open-source project that manages releases via pull requests.
However, there are some differences.

### No configuration needed üëç

Release-please requires two configuration files in cargo workspaces: `.release-please-manifest.json`
and `release-please-config.json`.
Most of the fields you have to write in these two files are already in the
`Cargo.toml` files.

Release-plz obtains all the information it needs from the `Cargo.toml` files
and the cargo registry,
so no configuration files are required.

### Versions retrieved from the cargo registry üëç

Release-please considers a package "published" only when the relative git tag exists.
Release-please doesn't interact at all with cargo registries.
However, some Rust projects don't create git tags.
Instead, they just publish the package to crates.io.

Release-plz looks at the cargo registry if the relative git tag doesn't exist,
making it compatible with both workflows and with the majority of the Rust projects.

### Conventional commits aren't required üëç

Release-please requires conventional commits to work.
For example, it only generates a release PR if your commit messages
start with `fix:`, `feat:`, or `deps:` (there are some exceptions based on the language).

Release-plz, instead, generates a release PR for every commit affecting one of your packages,
regardless of the commit message.
Release-plz also generates a release PR if you change the dependencies of your packages
(either in the `Cargo.toml` or in the `Cargo.lock` files).

### No multiple programming languages support üëé

Release-please supports multiple programming languages, while release-plz only
supports Rust projects.

## Differences with other Rust release tools

These are other release tools in the Rust ecosystem, but they primarily focus on
the CLI use case, while release-plz focuses mainly on CI.

- [cargo-release](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release):
  - Bumps the version and publishes Rust packages from the CLI.
  - It supports automatic releases with `cargo release --unpublished`
  - It doesn't have first-class support for changelogs.
    See [this](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release/issues/231) issue.
  - It supports hooks (release-plz doesn't).
- [cargo-workspaces](https://github.com/pksunkara/cargo-workspaces):
  - It's a set of commands to manage cargo workspaces and their crates.
  - The `publish` command releases the packages from the CLI similarly to `cargo-release`.
- [cargo-smart-release](https://github.com/Byron/cargo-smart-release):
  - Updates and publishes packages from the CLI.
  - It's very similar to release-plz, but it is not meant to be run in CI (see
    [this](https://github.com/release-plz/release-plz/issues/13#issuecomment-1065790846)
    comment from the author).
