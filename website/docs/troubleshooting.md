# Troubleshooting

## Release-plz GitHub action started misbehaving

> Did your release-plz GitHub action started misbehaving after a GitHub action [release](https://github.com/MarcoIeni/release-plz-action/releases)?

If yes, pin a specific version of the release-plz GitHub action in your workflow file.
E.g. go from `MarcoIeni/release-plz-action@v0.5` to `MarcoIeni/release-plz-action@v0.5.16`.
Determine the right version to pin by looking at the previous [releases](https://github.com/MarcoIeni/release-plz-action/releases)

Please open an [issue](https://github.com/MarcoIeni/release-plz/issues), too.
