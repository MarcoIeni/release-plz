# init

The `release-plz init` command initializes the necessary configurations and secrets for release-plz to work properly in your GitHub repository.

Note that release-plz uses the [gh](https://cli.github.com/) GitHub CLI to store the cargo registry token and the GitHub token in the GitHub repository secrets.
