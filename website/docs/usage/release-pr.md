# release-pr

The `release-plz release-pr` command runs [`release-plz update`](update.md) and
opens a GitHub Pull Request that prepares the next release.

When the project maintainer merges the release pull request, the packages are
ready to be published.

Here's an example of a [PR](https://github.com/MarcoIeni/release-plz/pull/377)
opened by release-plz in the release-plz GitHub project itself.

In the following example, I run `release-plz` on the `release-plz` project
itself.
`Release-plz` opens a PR that increases the version and the changelog of the
packages with unpublished changes.

## PR update

If there's already an open release PR:

- If the PR contains commits that are not from bots (except the first one),
  release-plz closes the PR to preserve the git history.
  The update mechanism is simple: overwrite everything and force-push. ðŸ’¥
  Reasoning: changes done by bots are not valuable, so we can overwrite them.
  (Not available on Gitea).
- Otherwise, release-plz closes the old PR and opens a new one.
  This is done to preserve the git history of maintainers' changes.
  Release-plz also closes the release PR when it cannot update it
  (for example, the force-push fails due to merge conflicts).

## Gitea

`release-plz release-pr` also supports creating PRs for repositories hosted on
Gitea with the `--backend` flag:

`release-plz release-pr --token <gitea application token> --backend gitea`
