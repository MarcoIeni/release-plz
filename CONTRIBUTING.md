## Glossary

- publish: A crate can be published to crates.io or to a private cargo registry.
- release: The release is the process that goes from updating the version through
  release-plz to publishing the single crate(s).
- package: For our purposes, crate and package are synonyms.
  In the codebase, we prefer to use the word `package` instead of `crate`.
